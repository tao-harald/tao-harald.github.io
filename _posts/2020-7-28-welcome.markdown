Welcome to my blog.

I've built my first blog in 2014 and many others in the last few years.
These blogs have closed because of many reasons, while I still have the willingness to re-open a blog to record my life and the path of becoming a more intelligent person.

I have a large number of hobbies although I'm not an expert on most of those hobbies. 
I'm happy with having those hobbies and this blog will record the life being with those hobbies.

On my own view, it's important to have hobbies in one's life for the reason that hobbies will give you the passion of living.
Thanks to my hobbies, I'm now learning math and doing research on deep learning and machine learning.

It will be fortunate if you have the same interests as me so you may learn something from this blog.
If not, you may be interested in the content about my daily life, which is also included in this blog.
