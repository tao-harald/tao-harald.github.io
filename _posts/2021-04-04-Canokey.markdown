I'm using [Canokey(STM32)](https://github.com/canokeys/canokey-stm32) to secure my account and data.

## Hardware

I'm using [NUCLEO-L432KC](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-L432KC/) development board with USB breakout [^1] .
As stated,
> The NFC and touch sensing functions are unavailable on NUCLEO board.

By default, Canokey hardware has a touchpad on it's `PH3` pin ([ref](https://github.com/canokeys/canokey-stm32/blob/490e140342f0993e36e3441a4b42739ef4955e85/Inc/main.h#L70)) while NUCLEO board hasn't.
Since touch function is indispensable in many authentications, you can work around it by replacing it with a button.
Simply saying, using a male to female jumper wire by linking the 3.3v pin and SB12 on the board when touch is required [^2] :

You can also make your own USB breakout board, on which you can add a **real** button to `PH3` pin:

## Firmware 
I'm using Arch Linux to build the Firmware:
```shell
sudo pacman -S arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib
git clone --recursive https://github.com/canokeys/canokey-stm32
cd canokey-stm32/ && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/arm-none-eabi- \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain.cmake \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make canokey.bin
```
Upload the `canokey.bin` to your development board. To initialize the Canokey, plug in your board [^3] and then execute:
```shell
cd ../utils/
./device-config-init.sh 'Canokeys Canokey [OpenPGP PIV OATH] (00000000) 00 00'
```
We are done here. Now you have a Canokey(STM32), use it to do something.


On NUCLEO board where the touchpad is changed to a button, you need to modify the firmware. Apply [nucleo.patch](/assets/file/nucleo.patch):
```shell
git apply nucleo.patch
```

## OpenPGP
By default
- PIN: `123456`
- Admin PIN: `12345678`

I use Kleopatra to generate Key on Canokey. You can choose another way you preferred to generate.

You can sign commits using GPG key on Canokey, using:
```shell
git commit -a -S -m 'Signed commit'
```
Before that, you should config your git:
```shell
gpg -K --keyid-format long # To get the long-keyid of your key
git config --global user.signingkey LONG_KEYID
```
, export the public key and add it to Github:
```shell
gpg --armor --export LONG_KEYID
```

If you meet **The email in this signature doesnâ€™t match the committer email.**, try to change the committer eamil:
```shell
git config --global user.email your.email@gpg.key
```
or add a new email address to your gpg key: [Associating an email with your GPG key
](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/associating-an-email-with-your-gpg-key).

If you want to sign every commit by default,
```shell
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

If you meet **error: gpg failed to sign the data**, which may be caused by no having `gtk2`. You should set `pinentry-program` in `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` [^4]
```
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-qt
```
or set the `GPG_TTY` environment variable for the pinentry programs. As I'm using fish,
```shell
set -Ux GPG_TTY (tty)
```

## OTP
Some websites (like Google, Github) support OTP as Two-factor authentication, you can use Canokey to secure and manage your OTP. 
To do so, just visit [Canokey Web Console](https://console.canokeys.org/oath) and connect your device. 
When adding a credential, the default config (for most websites) should be 
 - Key Encoding: Base32
 - Algorithm: HMAC-SHA1
 - Type: TOTP

After adding, you can click `Calculate TOTP` to get your OTP.


## FIDO2/U2F

You can set a PIN using Windows Hello. 

You can use your device to login website supporting WebAuthn.

You can also follow [this guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Universal_2nd_Factor) to authentication for Arch Linux.
```shell
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
```
will allow you to SSH with authentication from your Canokey. [Github](https://github.community/t/when-can-i-use-ssh-public-key-type-like-ed25519-sk-and-ecdsa-sk/3144) doesn't support `ecdsa-sk`.


## PIV 

By default
- PIN: `123456`
- PUK: `12345678`
- Management Key: `010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708`

To manage and initialize the PIV function, you should install `yubico-piv-tool`, and execute
```shell
yubico-piv-tool -r canokeys -a set-chuid
yubico-piv-tool -r canokeys -a set-ccc
```
Don't forget `-r canokeys` when you encounter **Failed to connect to yubikey.** 


[^1]: You can follow this [guide](https://shawnhymel.com/1795/getting-started-with-stm32-nucleo-usb-virtual-com-port/).

[^2]: Which is safer since no one knows how to finish the touching except the readers.

[^3]: You can use `pcsc_scan` to make sure you have plugged in your board.

[^4]: Don't forget to reload `gpg-agent` using `gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye`.
