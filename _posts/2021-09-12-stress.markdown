![Model of Stress](/assets/img/Transactional_Model_of_Stress_and_Coping_-_Richard_Lazarus.svg)

To deal with heavy pressure, one should get to know how stress is caused. 
The figure above illustrates the transactional model of stress and coping of Richard Lazarus. 
From the model, we can know that the potential dangers and insufficient resources to prevent them are two main reasons for stress.

> The model contends that stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressors as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. 
> Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate coping skills, then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressors. [^1]

The statements above lead us to emotion-focused and problem-focused strategies for dealing with stress.
> **Problem-focused** strategies employ action-oriented behavioral activities like planning, for example. 
> **Emotion-focused** strategies involve the expression of emotion and often include the altering of expectations.[^1]

> Time management skills which encompass goal setting, scheduling, and pacing are effective approaches to reducing stress. 
> Additionally, students should keep up their physical and mental health with regular exercise, healthy eating, good sleep habits, and [mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness) practices. [^2]

Mindfulness is the practice of purposely bringing one's attention to the present moment without evaluation, which comes from Buddhism although has more secular application nowadays, like reducing pressure.
