            <p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Saunders Mac Lane's <b><i>Categories for the Working Mathematician</i></b>.</p>
            <p>I provide an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields.  Starting from foundations, I illuminate the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality.  I then turn to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representation of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. </p>
