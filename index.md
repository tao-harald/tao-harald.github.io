## Preprint 
1. (with Heng Xie) The connecting homomorphism for Hermitian \\(K\\)-theory, [arxiv:2311.02318](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02318).

&emsp;In this work, we developed pushforwards and pullbacks in Hermitian \\(K\\)-theory using Grothendieck’s residue complexes, proving key results such as base change, projection, and excess intersection formulas. Additionally, we provided a geometric interpretation of the connecting homomorphism in the localization sequence. As an application, we computed the Hermitian \\(K\\)-theory of projective bundles and Grassmannians, presenting an explicit basis for Grassmannians indexed by even and buffalo-check Young diagrams.
